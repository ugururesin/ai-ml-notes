| Algorithm | Problem Type | Pros | Cons | Failure Modes | Remedies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linear Regression | Regression | Simple and easy to interpret, fast to train, can handle multiple input features | Sensitive to outliers, assumes linear relationships | Overfitting, Underfitting | Regularization, Feature selection, Ensemble methods |
| Logistic Regression | Classification | Simple and easy to interpret, fast to train, can handle multiple input features | Assumes linear relationships | Overfitting, Underfitting | Regularization, Feature selection, Ensemble methods |
| Decision Trees | Regression and Classification | Simple and easy to interpret, fast to train, can handle multiple input features and non-linear relationships | Prone to overfitting | Overfitting, Underfitting | Pruning, Ensemble methods |
| Random Forest | Regression and Classification | Can handle multiple input features and non-linear relationships, less prone to overfitting than decision trees | Slow to train, prone to overfitting with noisy data | Overfitting, Underfitting | Feature selection, Ensemble methods |
| Support Vector Machines | Classification | Can handle non-linear relationships, effective in high-dimensional spaces | Slow to train, sensitive to hyperparameters | Overfitting | Regularization, Feature selection, Ensemble methods |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Classification and Regression | Simple and easy to interpret, can handle multiple input features | Slow to train, sensitive to hyperparameters, does not work well in high-dimensional spaces | Overfitting, Underfitting | Feature selection, Ensemble methods |
| Naive Bayes | Classification | Fast to train, works well with a small number of input features | Assumes independence between input features, which is not always the case | Overfitting, Underfitting | Feature selection, Ensemble methods |
| Principal Component Analysis | Dimensionality Reduction | Fast to train, effective at reducing the dimensionality of the data | Loses information in the reduction process, may not capture non-linear relationships | Overfitting, Underfitting | Regularization, Ensemble methods |
