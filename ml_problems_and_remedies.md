## Common ML Problems and Remedy Measures

| Problem | Example | Remedy Measure |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Overfitting | A model fits training data too closely, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. | Regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping during model training. |
| Underfitting | A model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing data. | Using a more complex model architecture, increasing the number of training iterations, or adding more features to the dataset. |
| Data imbalance | A dataset has unequal representation of classes, leading to a biased model that performs well on the majority class but poorly on the minority class. | Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation to balance the dataset. |
| Data preprocessing | Poor data preprocessing can lead to noisy or incomplete data, negatively impacting model performance. | Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling before model training. |
| Feature selection | Selecting the most relevant features from a dataset to improve model performance. | Perform feature selection techniques such as PCA, Lasso regression, or mutual information. |
| Model selection | Choosing the right model architecture and hyperparameters. | Use techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or Bayesian optimization to select the best model and hyperparameters. |
| Interpretability | Machine learning models can be black boxes, making it difficult to interpret how they make predictions. | Use techniques such as feature importance analysis, SHAP values, or LIME to interpret and explain model predictions. |


## Advanced ML Problems and Remedy Measures

| Problem | Possible Solutions |
|---------|--------------------|
| Limited Training Data | Use techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or semi-supervised learning to generate more training data or make better use of the available data. |
| Model Selection | Use techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or Bayesian optimization to select the best model and hyperparameters for a given task. |
| Model Compression | Use techniques such as pruning, quantization, or knowledge distillation to reduce the size of the model while maintaining its accuracy. |
| Concept Drift Detection: Refers to the phenomenon where the statistical properties of the data distribution change over time, leading to a decrease in the model's performance. |	Use techniques such as monitoring the prediction errors, comparing the model's performance on the current data with the historical data, or using statistical tests to detect changes in the data distribution.|
