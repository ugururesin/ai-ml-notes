## Common ML Problems and Remedy Measures

| Problem | Example | Remedy Measure |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Overfitting | A model fits training data too closely, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. | Regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping during model training. |
| Underfitting | A model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing data. | Using a more complex model architecture, increasing the number of training iterations, or adding more features to the dataset. |
| Data imbalance | A dataset has unequal representation of classes, leading to a biased model that performs well on the majority class but poorly on the minority class. | Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation to balance the dataset. |
| Data preprocessing | Poor data preprocessing can lead to noisy or incomplete data, negatively impacting model performance. | Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling before model training. |
| Feature selection | Selecting the most relevant features from a dataset to improve model performance. | Perform feature selection techniques such as PCA, Lasso regression, or mutual information. |
| Model selection | Choosing the right model architecture and hyperparameters. | Use techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or Bayesian optimization to select the best model and hyperparameters. |
| Interpretability | Machine learning models can be black boxes, making it difficult to interpret how they make predictions. | Use techniques such as feature importance analysis, SHAP values, or LIME to interpret and explain model predictions. |
