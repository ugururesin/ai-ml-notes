| Punctuation tokenizer | "This is a sentence." | Handles punctuation well | May split contractions and compound words |
| Word tokenizer | "This is a sentence." | Handles contractions and compound words well | May split words with hyphens or slashes |
| Regex tokenizer | "This is a sentence." | Highly customizable | Requires knowledge of regular expressions |
| Sentence tokenizer | "This is a sentence. This is another sentence." | Splits text into sentences | May struggle with abbreviations or titles |
| Byte Pair Encoding tokenizer | "This is a sentence." | Handles rare or out-of-vocabulary words | Can result in large vocabularies |
