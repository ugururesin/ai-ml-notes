| Algorithm | Problem Type | Pros | Cons | Failure Modes | Remedies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Neural Networks | Regression and Classification | Can handle complex relationships and a large number of input features | Slow to train, sensitive to hyperparameters, requires a large amount of labeled data | Overfitting | Regularization, Transfer learning, Data augmentation, Early stopping |
| Convolutional Neural Networks | Image Classification | Can handle large amounts of image data, can extract features from images | Slow to train, requires a large amount of labeled data, sensitive to hyperparameters | Overfitting | Regularization, Transfer learning, Data augmentation, Early stopping |
| Recurrent Neural Networks | Sequence Prediction | Can handle sequential data, can maintain context over time | Slow to train, requires a large amount of labeled data, sensitive to hyperparameters | Overfitting, Vanishing gradients | Regularization,
